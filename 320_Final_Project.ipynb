    "# An Introduction to Data Science through League of Legends\n",

    "---\n",
    "League of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) that was developed and released by Riot Games in 2009. The standard gamemode consists of two teams, five players on each team, that fight to destroy the other team's nexus (base). Each player controls a champion (character) which each have their own unique sets of abilities. Along the way, team's can fight neutral objectives to gain powerups and other rewards in order to make their champions stronger as the game progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be many terms that are not familiar to those who have not played League of Legends. We have provided a list of terms with their definitions in order to make the tutorial more clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summoner: A player that is playing the game and controlling their character i.e player\n",
    "- Champion: The character that a player can control. There are many different champions in the game with many different abilities.\n",
    "- KDA: Kill Death Assists or KDA for short in the ratio of a participant's Kills and Assists per Death they have. (Kills + Assists) / Deaths\n",
    "- Ward: An item that provides vision to a certain portion of the map. The item can be synonymous to a \"torch\" that provides light in a dark area."

    "The code above goes through the process of accessing and collecting the data directly from Riot's APIs. In order to get a large amount of random data, we first used one of Riots API endpoints to get a list of featured games that have been played recently. The API request returns a large string that can be then parsed into a JSON object. Within the object is a `gameList` field which provides a list of the featured games. Within the `gameList` list, a `participants` field can be accessed which gives a list of participant usernames for a particular game in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `gameList`, all of the participants in each game can be stored within the `players` list. Since the featured games API endpoint only provides a small amount of games, we can instead use the recently played matches for each of the participants we stored allowing us to access many more matches that we could not get before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going through each player in the `players` list, we then need to call another API endpoint using each player's username. The way Riot's API works is that it is not possible to access individual player data through their username alone. Riot instead provides an option to acquire the PUUID, a universally unique identifer, that can then be used to access more information about each player. So, each player's username is used with an API endpoint to get their PUUID. Afterwards, their PUUID is used with another API endpoint to get the player's recent 20 matches that they have played. These matches come back as match IDS (ex: NA1_4301320954) which can then be used with another API endpoint to get more information about the particular match.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen through this process, data collection may sometimes not be a straightforward step. Some companies may provide many API endpoints but multiple API endpoints may need to be used in order to jump through the data and collect exactly what data you are looking for.\n",

    "Going through each match id in `matches`, we are then able to call another API endpoint from Riot in order to get a much more detailed overview of each match. After calling the API request, the data given back sometimes can have missing or unexpected values. For instance, the API is supposed to return a string of a JSON object with the field `info` containing the information of each game. However, we found that some calls the the API endpoint did not return an `info` field. In order to combat this issue, we simply checked to make sure the call returned an `info` field as any match without its info would be useless to us.\n",

    "        <li>\n",
    "            `game_mode` (string): In League of Legends, there are multiple game modes that a player could player. For this project we stuck with the most popular gamdemode, \"CLASSIC\".</li>\n",
    "        <li>\n",
    "            `win` (boolean): If they player won a given match, the variable is set to `True`. Otherwise, if the player lost, the variable is set to `False`.</li>\n",
    "        <li>\n",
    "            `vision` (double): In the CLASSIC mode of League of Legends, each player can see a small area of the map that they or their teammates are in. Otherwise, the map is hidden and the player cannot see any enemies within those regions. To combat the issue, players are given the ability to place \"wards\" which act as torches that can illuminate a certain area of a map for a certain period of time for them and their teammates. `vision` numerically tracks the effectiveness of a player's ability to give their team vision by giving them a point for each ward they provide and how long these wards last, and other metrics such as how many wards that they destroy from the other team.\n",

These monsters belong to neither team and can be killed by anybody in order to get their teams various rewards. Dragons, in particular, are a big neutral objective that gives teams very powerful powerups. The variables keeps track of how many dragons a player's team has killed within a match.\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "Similarly to the issues found with the inital API call to get the match info, each match sometimes did not contain a `participants` field or `challenges` field. Any match without these two fields were also skipped as the data would not be useful to us for this anlysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in previous data collection sections, large APIs can provide a great deal of information, but there are many hurdles that need to be overcome. Missing and unepected data is one hurdle, and large API outputs provide a unique hurdle in that there may be many nested objects that need to be traversed to find the data that you want."
