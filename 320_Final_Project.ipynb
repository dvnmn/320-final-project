    "The code above goes through the process of accessing and collecting the data directly from Riot's APIs. In order to get a large amount of random data, we first used one of Riots API endpoints to get a list of featured games that have been played recently. The API request returns a large string that can be then parsed into a JSON object. Within the object is a `gameList` field which provides a list of the featured games. Within the `gameList` list, a `participants` field can be accessed which gives a list of participant usernames for a particular game in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `gameList`, all of the participants in each game can be stored within the `players` list. Since the featured games API endpoint only provides a small amount of games, we can instead use the recently played matches for each of the participants we stored allowing us to access many more matches that we could not get before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going through each player in the `players` list, we then need to call another API endpoint using each player's username. The way Riot's API works is that it is not possible to access individual player data through their username alone. Riot instead provides an option to acquire the PUUID, a universally unique identifer, that can then be used to access more information about each player. So, each player's username is used with an API endpoint to get their PUUID. Afterwards, their PUUID is used with another API endpoint to get the player's recent 20 matches that they have played. These matches come back as match IDS (ex: NA1_4301320954) which can then be used with another API endpoint to get more information about the particular match.\n",

To combat the issue, players are given the ability to place \"wards\" which act as torches that can illuminate a certain area of a map for a certain period of time for them and their teammates. `vision` numerically tracks the effectiveness of a player's ability to give their team vision by giving them a point for each ward they provide and how long these wards last, and other metrics such as how many wards that they destroy from the other team.\n",

If the results happened by chance, then the experiment is not repeatable and thus, useless. When hypothesis testing, we want to determine what hypothesis we want to test. In this tutorial, we hypothesis that having a higher KDA leads to a higher frequency of winning. When hypothesis testing, we will use our hypothesis to determine a null hypothesis. As data scientists, we want to show that we have enough data to effectively reject our null hypothesis.

We can calculate the accuracy of our model by adding up the values in the main diagonal and divide that by our test size: $$\\frac{324+297}{324+86+108+297} = \\frac{621}{815} = 76.2\\%$$\n",

This is evident because a player can perform exceptionally well and have a high KDA, but they could still lose if their teammates are performing exceptionally bad. From our hypothesis test, we know that a high KDA increases their chances of winning, but there are also other many different factors to winning a game.
